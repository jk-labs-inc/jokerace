You can also find v1 at [jokedao.jokedao.io](https://jokedao.jokedao.io).

## Pre-requisites
- `yarn` installed
- `node` version >= `17.0.0`
- Have an Ethereum wallet (like MetaMask for instance)
## Before you start
- Navigate to `packages/react-app-revamp` (the v2 site package)
- Install dependencies with `yarn install`
- Create a `.env` file and paste the following values:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_INFURA_ID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_ETHERSCAN_KEY=
NEXT_PUBLIC_BLOCKNATIVE_DAPPID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_ALCHEMY_KEY=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
NEXT_PUBLIC_WEB3STORAGE_TOKEN=
```
## Getting Started

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Development Notes

### Updating bytecode

In order to generate and/or update the bytecode of your project, you first need to run 

```bash
yarn chain
```

to start a development chain locally.

Once you do that, run 

```bash
yarn deploy
```

Upon a successful deploy to the local development chain, this will copy the generated bytecode into the `react-app` (v1) and `react-app-revamp` (v2) packages so that the app can access it.

You will also need to do two more things:
  - Make a copy of the bytecode in the versioning folder `packages/react-app-revamp/contracts/bytecodeAndAbi` by copying the content in `Contest.sol`, which is the latest version of bytecode, into `contracts/bytecodeAndAbi` and renaming it following the convention.
  - Update ABI parser code in `packages/react-app-revamp/helpers/getContestContractVersion.ts` following the pattern of adding the last version of the bytecode and a code change that was distinctive to it (so that the front end can identify the version of bytecode it is looking at when trying to decipher a contract on a chain).

*Make sure to do all of these steps before committing any changes to the contract code to make sure that the bytecode that the site is deploying is the same as what you have written in the `hardhat` package!*
