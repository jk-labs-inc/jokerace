```bash
cd JokeDaoV2Dev

# Development Notes
 - `yarn deploy` will not only deploy to the local hardhat chain you are running, but upon a successful deploy it will copy the generated byte code into the `react-app` package so that the app can access it. Make sure to do this before committing any changes to the contract code to make sure that the byte code that the site is deploying is the same as what you have written in the `hardhat` package!
